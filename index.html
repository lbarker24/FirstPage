    <h2 class="overview"> Overview </h2>

    <p> The planets in our solar system include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These
        celestial bodies orbit around the sun, and each one has its own unique characteristics and features. Mercury is
        the closest planet to the sun and has a rocky surface with craters. Venus is known for its thick atmosphere that
        causes a greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in the solar system. Earth is the only planet that has
        the conditions necessary to sustain life. Mars, also known as the red planet, has a dry, dusty surface with the
        largest volcano and canyon in the solar system. Jupiter is the largest planet, with swirling clouds and a huge
        red spot. Saturn is known for its beautiful rings made of ice and rock. Uranus and Neptune are both known as
        "ice giants" and are primarily composed of water, methane, and ammonia. These planets and their unique features
        continue to fascinate scientists and space enthusiasts alike.</p>
